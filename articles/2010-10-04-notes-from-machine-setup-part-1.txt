title: Notes from Machine Setup Part 1
author: Sameer Chowdhury
date: 2010/10/04


	So, I'm trying to standardize on an install and procedure so I can work on a chef recipe for subsequent installs:

* Things I want to do fairly quickly:
  * Set up a toto blog that updates automatically through a git post commit hook
  * A reverse proxy setup with varnish -> passenger(reverse proxy) -> (rainbow/unicorn/passenger running in rvm under their own rubies and gems)
  * Run on mongodb entirely or in combination with postgres
  * setup a chef recipe for getting all of the above in place

So here's the notes.  I'll fill in the gaps with subsequent entries, but this is not comprehensive note taking at this point.

* CentOS 5.5

> would've preferred ubuntu but let's go with this for now.

* Apache

> don't ask, i would've preferred nginx.  but let's go with this for now.

* yum install httpd

* sameerchowdhury.com hosted at godaddy.com.  changed nameserver to: NS*.LINODE.COM

* added a new a record to linode.com:

* \*.sameerchowdhury.com 173.255.231.214

> I'm going to setup rails projects with capistrano but I wanted something up quick so here's to instant gratification:

	useradd deploy
	chown -R deploy:deploy /var/www
	mkdir -p /var/www/rails/blog/public
	vim /var/www/rails/blog/public/index.html #First Post

	vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

	....
	User deploy
	Group deploy
	....
